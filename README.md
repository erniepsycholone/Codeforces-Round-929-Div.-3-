# Codeforces Round #929 (Div. 3)

This repository contains the complete problem set, official test data, solutions, validators, and editorials from **Codeforces Round #929 (Div. 3)** — an online global programming contest that attracted over **42,300 participants from 81 countries**.

As project director of this round, I led the authoring, testing, and editorial writing process. The set includes 7 problems of varied difficulty, covering a wide range of algorithmic topics that help coders around the world of different programming proficiencies to test their abilities.

The contest lasted for 2 hours and 15 minutes, hosted by the rules of educational rounds (extended ICPC). Thus, solutions were judged on preliminary tests during the round, and after the round, a 12-hour phase of open hacking. The penalty for a wrong submission was equal to 10 minutes. This round was rated for participants with ratings lower than 1600. All who had a rating of 1600 or higher were welcome to register for the round unofficially.
